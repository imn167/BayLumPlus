# BayLum <img width=120px src="man/figures/logo_BayLum.png" align="right" />

An R package for chronological **Bay**esian models integrated for
Optically Stimulated (OSL) **Lum**inescence Dating

**BayLumPlus** is a a refined fork of the original
[`BayLum`](https://crp2a.github.io/BayLum/) R package. This update
introduces several new capabilities, particularly for the Age
processing, where we aim to test different prior assumptions without
incurring the computational cost associated with the Palaeodose Model.

## Installation

**You need to have [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io) installed on
your computer.**

The package **BayLum** has only a development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("imn167/BayLumPLus")
```

Please note that development versions may change day by day.

## About this Extension

### Graph Theory for Stratigraphic Constraints

To support the modeling of stratigraphic relationships, we introduce
graph-based functions:

- `buildNetwork()` – builds a network from stratigraphic input  
- `network_vizualization()` – visualizes stratigraphic constraints as a
  graph  
- `remove_transitive_edges()` – removes redundant edges implied by
  transitivity

These tools help simplify and explore complex stratigraphic
relationships more intuitively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bayesian Age Modeling with `Compute_AgeS_D()`

We introduce a new modeling function: `Compute_AgeS_D()`, focused on
Bayesian age estimation under various prior structures.

**Supported priors include:**

- `StrictOrder`: Uniform order on the log-scale (chain-like
  constraints)  
- `StrictNicholls`: Based on the Uniform Order prior, from the original
  `BayLum`  
- `Independence`: For unstructured or weakly constrained stratigraphy

This function behaves similarly to `AgeS_Computation()` but adds two
additional outputs:

- The **standard deviation** of each estimated age  
- The **time-series standard error**, useful in detecting
  heteroscedasticity

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Isotonic Distortion Framework

`BayLumPlus` introduces a new Bayesian modeling strategy called
**Isotonic Distortion**, implemented via:

- `IsotonicCurve()` – fits the isotonic model  
- `PlotIsotonicCurve()` – visualizes the result

This framework supports structured monotonic trends in ages, offering a
flexible and interpretable alternative to traditional priors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comparing Priors with `plotHpd()`

To facilitate the comparison of different modeling choices and prior
structures, the `plotHpd()` function allows visual comparison of
**Highest Posterior Density (HPD)** intervals under different model
settings.

This is particularly useful for:

- Sensitivity analysis  
- Model comparison  
- Reporting credible intervals with varying assumptions
